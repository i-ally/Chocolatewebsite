                            <p>The cacao tree was first found to be useful for its seeds about two thousand years ago. Early Central Americans and Mexicans used the seeds from the cacao tree to make a drink that tasted bitter, not sweet. Only the important
                                people could drink it. The word for "chocolate" in almost every language comes from its name in the Nahuatl language of Mexico, Chocolate. Later on, this drink was made sweeter and made into what is known today as hot chocolate.
                                It was made popular by Spanish explorers who brought it from North America to Spain.[4] When chocolate was sweetened and made into candy, it became a very popular treat for many Europeans. At first, only the rich could
                                afford chocolate. Now, many people enjoy it. Most cocoa today is made in Africa.</p>
